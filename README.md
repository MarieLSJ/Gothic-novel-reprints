Reprinting of first-wave Gothic novels in the 19th century: method and dataset

An initial version of the data paper accompanying these datasets is published on my open notebook, _Price One Penny, new series_:
https://popnewseries.hypotheses.org/574

The following datasets are available as separate tabs in a spreadsheet provided in OpenDocument Spreadsheet (.ods), an open standard file format that can be opened in OpenOffice, LibreOffice, Excel, Numbers, or Google Spreadsheets.

## Dataset A
The final table of 13 collections, series, or publishers from the 19th century reprinting 29 first-wave Gothic novels grouped into categories.

## Dataset B
A preliminary version of the previous table containing 48 publishers, collections, or series from the 19th century that have reprinted 35 novels that could have been construed as part of first-wave Gothic.

## Dataset C
A different table of 12 “libraries” present in two catalogues for Milner & Co (four in the first, eight in the second) and reprinting 15 Gothic novels, forming a subset of the 35 novels in the previous dataset.


All three datasets contain novels listed in rows and collection, publishers, or series listed in columns. If the novel in a given row was reprinted in the collection or series or by the publisher in a given column, the cell where they intersect will contain a date (the earliest reprint of that novel found in that collection or series or by that publisher), a volume number, some other information, or simply an "x".

More information in the "Read me" tab of the spreadsheet.
